# svm
this repository showcases a hybrid approach, combining the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset.  
In this project, we leverage the feature extraction capabilities of a CNN and the classification prowess of an SVM. The process includes data preprocessing, CNN model training, feature extraction, SVM training, and evaluation, resulting in a robust and accurate classifier.

Dataset: The dataset includes thousands of labeled images of cats and dogs, providing ample data for training and testing.
CNN Model: A deep CNN is trained to extract meaningful features from images, utilizing layers like Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, BatchNormalization, and Dropout.
Feature Extraction: The trained CNN model serves as a feature extractor, transforming images into high-level feature representations.
SVM Classifier: An SVM classifier is trained on the extracted features to distinguish between cat and dog images.
Evaluation: Both the CNN and SVM models are evaluated, with performance metrics and visualizations provided for comprehensive assessment.
